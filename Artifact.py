'''
Artifacts
Artifacts represent machines or magical objects. Like creatures, you can cast an artifact as a spell during your main 
phase, and it remains on the battlefield unless itâ€™s destroyed, sacrificed, exiled, or otherwise removed. Most artifacts
are colorless, which means you can cast them with any color of mana.
